                    We describe a clear need to transform healthcare systems
                    across the world to achieve better health outcomes at
                    affordable costs and additional challenges in countries like
                    India of an acute shortage of doctors. We argue that this
                    transformation is possible through a combination of a
                    patient-centric approach and proactive care enabled by
                    artificial intelligence (AI). We present examples of machine
                    learning techniques to support more proactive care at
                    various tiers of healthcare systems, including ICUs,
                    secondary and primary healthcare centers, and more
                    importantly, at home or work. In particular, we present our
                    team's work on diabetic retinopathy screening using a
                    convolutional neural network based approach and newly
                    initiated work on preventing and managing cardio-vascular
                    disease through lifestyle modifications and early medical
                    interventions. We describe several outstanding challenges
                    that need to be overcome in order to achieve meaningful
                    impact in the real world.

                    The talk will provide an overview of epidemiological model
                    for disease spread. Specifically, we will discuss why
                    agent-based models are useful, the components of agent-based
                    models, and the various issues related to their validation.
                    We will then turn to COVID-19 and will survey a few
                    agent-based models in use (that we are aware of). The talk
                    will end with a discussion of the outcomes of the TIFR-IISc

                    what may be happening in Mumbai.

                    The COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide disruptions to
                    societies and to economies. Slowing economies are also
                    impacting medical facilities and how madical infrastructure
                    is used. Crude Oil prices, on the other hand, are a very
                    good indicator of the economic conditions globally. Reducing
                    economic impacts of the pandemic is a serious societal
                    challenge. In this study, we investigate the problem of
                    predicting oil prices under the light of the current crisis
                    and study how coronavirus has changed oil markets.

                    Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has posed severe challenges and
                    unveiled many opportunities across several domains, with
                    Healthcare being prominently affected. The key challenges

                    quarantining and monitoring, hospital management,
                    cross-contamination at the COVID hospitals, the safety of

                    architecture of IoMT along with potential applications and
                    use cases like IoT-enabled thermal screening, disease

                    the talk, the speaker will shed some light on the open
                    research problems and challenges to implementing IoMT in

                    Today, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic are well known
                    across the community. Manufacturing industries are
                    challenged because of the unexpected, strict and long-period
                    of lockdown. During such times, the demand for essential
                    items increases while non-essential items decreases.
                    Industries require to work on a strategic model to recover
                    from the pandemic situation as soon as possible. Such a
                    recovery model with the help of an example, parameters,
                    equations, inputs and outputs will be discussed. Industry
                    4.0 and Pharma 4.0 concept will be introduced with some case
                    studies. The talk will end covering the effect of the
                    pandemic on these concepts.

                    Corona virus has disrupted the world. It is important to
                    find various means of diagnosis to curtail the spread.
                    Medical Image analysis based on AI can play crucial role in
                    the diagnostics and later prognosis of this disease. The
                    short talk will answer the question; how can AI help to
                    fight against COVID19 by providing quick and accurate
                    diagnosis of the patient.
