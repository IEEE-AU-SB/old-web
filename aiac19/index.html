              In this worldwide pandemic situation, it is essential to look for
              newer technology to control the Corona Virus spread. Artificial
              Intelligence (AI) is one such potent defense against this virus.
              It helps prevent the infection in real-time or predict the
              mortality rate by analyzing data. It is also useful in population
              screening, medical planning, identifying hotspots, and bodies with
              appropriate evidence and advice on infection control. The virtual
              national workshop AIAC19 aims to bring forward such AI
              applications, which can help fight menace.
